# MyProjects




Location of a shopping mall plays an important role in predicting if it will be a success or a failure. So, in this project, we try to analyse which area in the Kuala Lumpur city, Malaysia will pave way for the success of building a new mall. It would be really helpful for property developers as it answers the question, "Where do you recommend opening a new shopping mall in KL, Malaysia?"


In the KL.ipynb, KL neighborhoods are analysed.

In the Chennai.ipynb, the neighborhoods of Chennai, India are analysed.
